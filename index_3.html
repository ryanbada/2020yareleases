  <h2>January 2020 Most Anticipated: A Heart So Fierce and Broken by Brigid Kemmerer</h2>
    <img id="book" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1559126810l/42952728.jpg" alt="Book">
    <p>Find the heir, win the crown.</p>
    <p>The curse is finally  broken, but Prince Rhen of Emberfall faces darker troubles still. Rumors circulate that he is not the true heir and that forbidden magic has been unleashed in Emberfall. Although Rhen has Harper by his side, his guardsman Grey is missing, leaving more questions than answers.</p>
    <p>Win the crown, save the kingdom.</p>
    <p>Rumored to be the heir, Grey has been on the run since he destroyed Lilith. He has no desire to challenge Rhen--until Karis Luran once again threatens to take Emberfall by force. Her own daughter Lia Mara sees the flaws in her mother’s violent plan, but can she convince Grey to stand against Rhen, even for the good of Emberfall?</p> 
    <p>The heart-pounding, compulsively readable saga continues as loyalties are tested and new love blooms in a kingdom on the brink of war. In the sequel to New York Times bestselling A Curse So Dark and Lonely, Brigid Kemmerer returns to the world of Emberfall in a lush fantasy where friends become foes and love blooms in the darkest of places.</p>

  <h2>February 2020 Most Anticipated: All the Stars and Teeth by Adalyn Grace</h2>
    <img id="book" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562221314l/38325332._SY475_.jpg" alt="All The Stars and Teeth">
    <p>Set in a kingdom where danger lurks beneath the sea, mermaids seek vengeance with song, and magic is a choice.</p>
    <p>She will reign.</p>
    <p>As princess of the island kingdom Visidia, Amora Montara has spent her entire life training to be High Animancer — the master of souls. The rest of the realm can choose their magic, but for Amora, it’s never been a choice. To secure her place as heir to the throne, she must prove her mastery of the monarchy’s dangerous soul magic.</p>
    <p>When her demonstration goes awry, Amora is forced to flee. She strikes a deal with Bastian, a mysterious pirate: he’ll help her prove she’s fit to rule, if she’ll help him reclaim his stolen magic.</p>
    <p>But sailing the kingdom holds more wonder — and more peril — than Amora anticipated. A destructive new magic is on the rise, and if Amora is to conquer it, she’ll need to face legendary monsters, cross paths with vengeful mermaids, and deal with a stow-away she never expected… or risk the fate of Visidia and lose the crown forever.</p>
    <p>I am the right choice. The only choice. And I will protect my kingdom.</p>

        <q>“Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.”</q>
